## Simple Client implemented using sockets - sends a
## GET request to the server including some user defined
## text and the server returns the text in all caps.
## It's then printed to the screen to the user.

#Define the hostname and port number to connect to

hostname = "127.0.0.1"

#Create a new TCP socket using the hostname and port of the server

#Get input from the user and format for use within the
#HTTP request - note the different format for Ruby

input.split.size

#Read the response from the server, remove the lines user not interested in
#and print the all caps text

#Close the socket and finish
